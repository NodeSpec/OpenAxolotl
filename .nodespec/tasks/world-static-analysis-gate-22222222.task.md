# Task: World Static Analysis Gate

> **Scope:** implement ONLY this node ("World Static Analysis Gate"). Work belonging to other nodes appears here solely as interfaces and coordination points — do not implement or re-derive it.
> This document is DERIVED from the NodeSpec model + catalog (fingerprinted, regenerable via generate_task_docs). Node context/export is the model truth; propose model changes through the proposal flow — hand-edits to model facts here do not change the model.

## Component Purpose

**Role:** CLI Tool
**Technology:** Python
**Description:** Command-line interface application for developer or operator interaction

## Your Deliverable

**Working code for this component**, honoring the contracts and criteria below, plus its configuration artifacts and tests.

## Implementation Context

<!-- AI-AUTHORED SECTION: NodeSpec never writes prose here. Your text survives regeneration verbatim while the derived sections around it keep refreshing. -->
_Not yet authored._ **Consuming AI — author this section BEFORE building.** Working from this full packet plus the repository, record the project-specific context no catalog can know: how this node's technology composes with its neighbors in THIS project, the integration specifics behind each interface contract, configuration rationale, and your intended implementation approach. Replace this placeholder (keep the heading) either by editing this file in the repo and pushing — NodeSpec surfaces the edit as a change card for the user to accept — or via an update_artifact patch through propose_patches. If a REVIEW-NEEDED line appears here later, the derived context changed after you wrote this: re-verify the section, then delete that line.

- [ ] **T28 — Verify every acceptance criterion above and tick its box.** <!-- t:7cb6cb39 -->
  Ordering doctrine — plans follow schemas (contract-first TDD): schemas → test plans → implement → verify. Resolve any open [PLACEHOLDER: schema] gap FIRST (get_build_readiness supplies draftInputs; submit the schema via propose_patches update_contract) — test-plan scenarios touching a schemaless contract stay one-line [blocked by schema: …] markers until the schema lands, then the plan refreshes itself.
  AUTOMATED criteria: call get_test_plan for EACH requirement this node serves, implement the plan's test cases, run them, and report every outcome via report_test_results — a passing result flips the criterion's met flag automatically and the response receipt shows which criteria flipped.
  MANUAL criteria (rows marked (manual) above): report_test_results REFUSES to bind them — prove each by ticking its criterion box in this task doc and having the user approve the resulting change card; that approval is the only thing that flips a manual criterion met.
  This node is complete only when every criterion box is ticked and no `[PLACEHOLDER: …]` tag remains open.

**Your first action — expand these work orders.** Each task above guarantees WHAT must be covered, not HOW. Before writing any code or configuration, expand every task with the concrete implementation steps for THIS technology in THIS project — the specific resources, settings, files, schemas, and tests — using the Configuration, Interface Contracts, Technology Guidance, and node context as your references. Record the expanded list in this section via update_artifact (propose_patches) after this doc is accepted, keeping task IDs, criterion citations, and open `[PLACEHOLDER: …]` tags intact. Resolve placeholders with the user through the proposal flow; this node is never complete while one remains open. When the work orders are implemented, verify through the test lane: run get_test_plan for each requirement this node serves, implement and run the plan's tests, and report outcomes via report_test_results — passing results are the evidence that flips criteria met.

## Project Context

OpenAxolotl — Play it. Fork it. Build a world.

A colorful 3D action-platformer in Godot where a tiny axolotl explores strange aquatic worlds, restoring damaged habitats and rescuing creatures. Every world is a self-contained module anyone — human or AI coding agent — can fork, replace, or extend. Open source is a gameplay feature, not a line in the README.

FOUR PILLARS

1. Regeneration is the constant loop; lives are the hard failure state. Damage strips a capability — tail, gill, leg — with comedic pop-and-sparkle framing rather than draining a health bar, and never ends a run on its own. A separate limited life count is spent only on catastrophic events and returns the player to the last checkpoint. Regeneration stays expressive and ever-present; lives supply the stakes.

2. Two movement grammars, one axolotl. Water and land are mechanically distinct, joined by a water-powered dash as the signature transition skill. This is the answer to "why is this not a cute skin on generic platformer mechanics."

3. The world regenerates with you. Regions progress barren, resourced, restored — opening real traversal paths rather than swapping visuals — and Drift Fleet dredgers can undo that progress. This carries the open-source metaphor mechanically, without a child ever needing to notice it.

4. The repo is the game. Every world conforms to a versioned Level Contract published as a machine-readable schema. A contributor never needs to understand the whole game, only the contract. The project is effectively an open-source platformer SDK.

ANTAGONISTS
The Drift Fleet: faceless industrial extraction machinery, deliberately never human characters. Nets, hooks, dredges and pollution, with no gore and no humanized violence — the same machinery that broke the habitat is what the player disables to heal it.

MVP SCOPE
PC only. Two official worlds plus a minimal reference template. Three Gill Mods — Bubble, Jet, Glow — built to depth rather than breadth; Electric, Frost and Giant are post-MVP and double as the reference example for community-built mods. Contract compliance, asset conformance, and world static analysis are automated and merge-blocking, so an AI agent can verify its own work before submitting.

COMMUNITY (post-MVP)
Opens only once Level Contract v1 is frozen; opening earlier means every core update breaks early contributor worlds. Community worlds ship code like any other world — safety comes from static analysis against the sanctioned world API surface plus mandatory human review, never an automated-only merge path. This is a family game with an agent-authored contribution pipeline, so that gate is load-bearing.

NON-GOALS (firm, not deferrals)
No multiplayer, in any phase. No console certification. No level-editor GUI, ever — worlds are authored as code and Godot scenes only, so humans and AI agents build the same way and the contract surface stays narrow enough to check.

OPEN ITEMS
Licensing split between code and official art/audio, entangled with AI-generation provenance. Save-compatibility policy for forked and divergent worlds.

## Requirements — Your Scope

### REQ-020: Community Lagoon Submission Pipeline (Post-MVP)
Category: business | Status: in-progress
POST-MVP, and strictly sequenced: this opens only after Level Contract v1 is frozen. Opening earlier means every core update breaks early contributor worlds and burns exactly the goodwill the project depends on. Contributors submit worlds by pull request; accepted worlds become packaged community worlds surfaced in the hub as Community Lagoon portals, visibly credited to their author. SECURITY MODEL: community worlds are GDScript modules exactly like official worlds — the code-authoring premise applies to everyone, and there is no separate data-only contributor path. Safety therefore comes from two controls rather than from forbidding code: automated static analysis that rejects any world script reaching outside the sanctioned world API surface defined by the Level Contract (no filesystem, network, OS-execution, or dynamic-evaluation calls), and mandatory human maintainer review before merge. Both stages are required; there is no automated-only merge path. This gating is load-bearing rather than a nicety — this is a game marketed to families with an AI-agent-authored contribution pipeline, and an ungated path would be the project's largest risk. Tiering is Official, Community, and Experimental Lagoons.

**Acceptance criteria — your task boxes:**
- [ ] Every submission passes automated contract-compliance and content-policy pre-screening before human review
  → covered by Task T6
- [ ] Static analysis rejects any community world script calling filesystem, network, OS-execution, or dynamic-evaluation APIs, or otherwise reaching outside the sanctioned world API surface defined by the Level Contract
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] A deliberately malicious fixture world attempting each forbidden call class is rejected by the static-analysis gate
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] Every submission requires explicit human maintainer approval before merge, enforced by branch protection with no automated-only merge path
  → covered by Task T22
- [ ] Accepted community worlds are packaged and surfaced in the hub as Community Lagoon portals credited to their author
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] Portal tiering distinguishes Official, Community, and Experimental Lagoons
  → covered by Task T23
- [ ] Pipeline opens only after Level Contract v1 is declared frozen (manual)
  → covered by Task T24
- [ ] Content guidelines and the maintainer review checklist are documented for a family-audience bar (manual)
  → covered by Task T25

### REQ-030: No Multiplayer — Enforced Single-Player Constraint
Category: technical | Status: in-progress
"No multiplayer" is a firm non-goal in every phase, and this requirement makes it machine-enforced rather than merely stated. The enforcement exists because the constraint is actively working against its environment: general Godot guidance, sample code, and the engine's own documentation are heavily multiplayer-oriented, and the technology guidance embedded in this project's own node context carries an RPC/server-authority movement sample that directly contradicts this non-goal. A human or AI contributor following ordinary Godot idiom would reach for @rpc and MultiplayerAPI without ever intending to add multiplayer. A documented non-goal cannot stop that; a merge-blocking static check can. Scope is deliberately repo-wide — core systems, official worlds, the reference template, and community submissions alike — because the risk is highest in exactly the core movement and input code where the contradicting sample appears. Single-player also means no network layer at all: no peers, no synchronizers, no authority checks, no server-side validation scaffolding.

**Acceptance criteria — your task boxes:**
- [ ] A static check rejects any use of Godot multiplayer APIs, including @rpc annotations, rpc/rpc_id/rpc_config calls, is_multiplayer_authority and set_multiplayer_authority, the multiplayer property and MultiplayerAPI, any MultiplayerPeer implementation (ENet, WebRTC, WebSocket), and MultiplayerSynchronizer or MultiplayerSpawner nodes
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] The check scans core systems, official worlds, the reference template, and community submissions — not world modules alone
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] A fixture file exercising each forbidden multiplayer API class is rejected by the check, with output naming the specific API and file
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] The check runs as a required CI check and a pull request introducing any forbidden multiplayer API cannot merge
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] project.godot declares no networking or multiplayer autoloads, peer configuration, or network-related project settings
  → covered by Task T26
- [ ] No architecture node is a game server, and no networking or multiplayer service appears anywhere in the project's technology set
  → covered by Task T27
- [ ] The Level Contract's sanctioned world API surface lists every multiplayer API as forbidden, so world modules are covered by the same ban as core
  → covered by Task T2
- [ ] Contributor documentation states the project is single-player only and warns that general Godot multiplayer guidance and engine sample code do not apply here (manual)
  → covered by Task T6

## Technology Guidance

_Reference for executing the Implementation Tasks above — apply where relevant. The task list stands even where this guidance is thin._

**Purpose:** The default language for data/ML-adjacent backends and a first-class choice for typed API services (FastAPI + Pydantic). Spans API services, workers, ML pipelines, inference services, webhook handlers and CLIs — when the component touches the data/ML ecosystem, Python is usually the honest pick.

**SDK Initialization:**
```
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic-settings
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health(): return {"status": "ok"}

# uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Common API Patterns:**

#### REST Endpoint
FastAPI endpoint with dependency injection and response model
```
@app.get("/api/users/{user_id}", response_model=UserResponse)
async def get_user(user_id: int, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    user = await db.get(User, user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user
```

#### Dependency Injection
Composable dependency chain for DB sessions and auth
```
async def get_db() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    async with async_session() as session:
        yield session

async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme), db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)) -> User:
    payload = verify_token(token)
    return await db.get(User, payload["sub"])
```

#### Background Task
Celery task for async background processing
```
from celery import Celery
celery_app = Celery("tasks", broker="redis://localhost:6379")

@celery_app.task
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    smtp_client.send(to=to, subject=subject, body=body)
```

**Configuration Template:**
```
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "myapp"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.110.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0",
    "sqlalchemy[asyncio]>=2.0.0",
    "pydantic-settings>=2.0.0",
]

[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py311"
select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP"]

[tool.mypy]
strict = true
plugins = ["pydantic.mypy"]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Type hints everywhere + Pydantic models at every boundary — FastAPI turns them into validation and OpenAPI for free
- uv for env + deps (committed lockfile, pinned python version); one venv per service
- Async where the framework is async — mixing blocking calls (requests, raw psycopg) into async handlers is the classic FastAPI foot-gun; use httpx/asyncpg
- Workers: Celery or arq with explicit idempotency — Python queue consumers WILL be redelivered
- ruff for lint+format (one tool), pytest with fixtures over unittest classes

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Blocking I/O inside async routes (sync DB drivers, requests) — kills the event loop invisibly
- requirements.txt without pins in a production service
- Django for a pure JSON API where FastAPI is lighter — Django earns its weight only when the admin/ORM/auth batteries are used
- Global mutable module state as a cache — breaks under multiple workers

**Security:** Use Pydantic models for automatic input validation on all endpoints. Use parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM, never raw string interpolation. Set CORS middleware with explicit allowed origins. Use python-jose or PyJWT for JWT validation. Pin dependencies and use pip-audit for vulnerability scanning. Never run uvicorn with --reload in production.

**Integration Patterns:**
- FastAPI or Flask for HTTP framework with automatic OpenAPI docs
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 with asyncio for async database access
- Celery or ARQ for distributed task queues
- Pydantic for data validation and settings management
- pytest with httpx.AsyncClient for async API testing

**Suggested File Structure:**
- `src/main.py` (source)
- `src/routes/__init__.py` (source)
- `pyproject.toml` (config)
