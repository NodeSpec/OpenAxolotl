# Task: World: Bubble Bay

> **Scope:** implement ONLY this node ("World: Bubble Bay"). Work belonging to other nodes appears here solely as interfaces and coordination points — do not implement or re-derive it.
> This document is DERIVED from the NodeSpec model + catalog (fingerprinted, regenerable via generate_task_docs). Node context/export is the model truth; propose model changes through the proposal flow — hand-edits to model facts here do not change the model.

## Component Purpose

**Role:** Shared Library
**Technology:** Godot
**Description:** Reusable code package consumed as a dependency by other services

## Your Deliverable

**Working code for this component**, honoring the contracts and criteria below, plus its configuration artifacts and tests.

## Implementation Context

<!-- AI-AUTHORED SECTION: NodeSpec never writes prose here. Your text survives regeneration verbatim while the derived sections around it keep refreshing. -->
_Not yet authored._ **Consuming AI — author this section BEFORE building.** Working from this full packet plus the repository, record the project-specific context no catalog can know: how this node's technology composes with its neighbors in THIS project, the integration specifics behind each interface contract, configuration rationale, and your intended implementation approach. Replace this placeholder (keep the heading) either by editing this file in the repo and pushing — NodeSpec surfaces the edit as a change card for the user to accept — or via an update_artifact patch through propose_patches. If a REVIEW-NEEDED line appears here later, the derived context changed after you wrote this: re-verify the section, then delete that line.

## Implementation Tasks

Ordered WORK ORDERS synthesized from the model — this node's deliverable kind, contracts, criterion attribution, configuration, and dependency chain. They guarantee coverage, scope, and traceability; they deliberately do NOT contain the implementation detail — that is your job (see the expansion directive below the list).

- [ ] **T1 — Scaffold the Godot component.**
  Create the source layout, build files, and test harness this node's working code lives in.
  Start from the catalog's suggested structure: `scripts/main.gd`, `scenes/main.tscn`, `project.godot`, `export_presets.cfg`.
- [ ] **T2 — Implement the integration with Restoration State System (godot) per Contract "Restoration Region Interface" (dependency).**
  Dependency contract — capture the reference/identifier wiring in this node's config artifacts; no payload schema expected.

  Dependency contract — capture the reference/identifier wiring in this node's config artifacts; no payload schema expected.
- [ ] **T9 — Expose the interface OpenAxolotl Game Client consumes, per Contract "Level Contract v1" (dependency).**
  Record the endpoint/identifiers OpenAxolotl Game Client needs in this node's config artifacts — coordinate with OpenAxolotl Game Client.
  Dependency contract — capture the reference/identifier wiring in this node's config artifacts; no payload schema expected.
  ↳ serves (unverified match): REQ-028 "Bubble Bay passes the Level Contract compliance checker" — requirement not mapped to that node; verify or reassign before relying on it
  ↳ serves (unverified match): REQ-028 "Bubble Bay declares no boss and remains contract-valid and fully completable, proving the optional-boss path" — requirement not mapped to that node; verify or reassign before relying on it
- [ ] **T10 — Expose the interface Level Contract Compliance Checker consumes, per Contract "Level Contract v1" (dependency).**
  Record the endpoint/identifiers Level Contract Compliance Checker needs in this node's config artifacts — coordinate with Level Contract Compliance Checker.
  Dependency contract — capture the reference/identifier wiring in this node's config artifacts; no payload schema expected.

  Record the endpoint/identifiers World Static Analysis Gate needs in this node's config artifacts — coordinate with World Static Analysis Gate.
  Dependency contract — capture the reference/identifier wiring in this node's config artifacts; no payload schema expected.

- [ ] **T12 — Implement: "Bubble Bay is completable from spawn to finish condition" (REQ-028).**
  No interface contract maps to this criterion — it is this node's internal responsibility.
  ↳ serves: REQ-028 "Bubble Bay is completable from spawn to finish condition"
- [ ] **T13 — Implement: "Bubble Bay sustains the documented frame-rate target on the baseline specification during normal traversal" (REQ-028).**
  No interface contract maps to this criterion — it is this node's internal responsibility.
  ↳ serves: REQ-028 "Bubble Bay sustains the documented frame-rate target on the baseline specification during normal traversal"
- [ ] **T14 — Implement: "Bubble Bay is fun to play through and delivers a satisfying broken-to-restored payoff" (REQ-028).**
  No interface contract maps to this criterion — it is this node's internal responsibility.
  ↳ serves: REQ-028 "Bubble Bay is fun to play through and delivers a satisfying broken-to-restored payoff"
- [ ] **T15 — Verify every acceptance criterion above and tick its box.**
  Ordering doctrine — plans follow schemas (contract-first TDD): schemas → test plans → implement → verify. Resolve any open [PLACEHOLDER: schema] gap FIRST (get_build_readiness supplies draftInputs; submit the schema via propose_patches update_contract) — test-plan scenarios touching a schemaless contract stay one-line [blocked by schema: …] markers until the schema lands, then the plan refreshes itself.
  AUTOMATED criteria: call get_test_plan for EACH requirement this node serves, implement the plan's test cases, run them, and report every outcome via report_test_results — a passing result flips the criterion's met flag automatically and the response receipt shows which criteria flipped.
  MANUAL criteria (rows marked (manual) above): report_test_results REFUSES to bind them — prove each by ticking its criterion box in this task doc and having the user approve the resulting change card; that approval is the only thing that flips a manual criterion met.
  This node is complete only when every criterion box is ticked and no `[PLACEHOLDER: …]` tag remains open.

**Your first action — expand these work orders.** Each task above guarantees WHAT must be covered, not HOW. Before writing any code or configuration, expand every task with the concrete implementation steps for THIS technology in THIS project — the specific resources, settings, files, schemas, and tests — using the Configuration, Interface Contracts, Technology Guidance, and node context as your references. Record the expanded list in this section via update_artifact (propose_patches) after this doc is accepted, keeping task IDs, criterion citations, and open `[PLACEHOLDER: …]` tags intact. Resolve placeholders with the user through the proposal flow; this node is never complete while one remains open. When the work orders are implemented, verify through the test lane: run get_test_plan for each requirement this node serves, implement and run the plan's tests, and report outcomes via report_test_results — passing results are the evidence that flips criteria met.

## Project Context

OpenAxolotl — Play it. Fork it. Build a world.

A colorful 3D action-platformer in Godot where a tiny axolotl explores strange aquatic worlds, restoring damaged habitats and rescuing creatures. Every world is a self-contained module anyone — human or AI coding agent — can fork, replace, or extend. Open source is a gameplay feature, not a line in the README.

FOUR PILLARS

1. Regeneration is the constant loop; lives are the hard failure state. Damage strips a capability — tail, gill, leg — with comedic pop-and-sparkle framing rather than draining a health bar, and never ends a run on its own. A separate limited life count is spent only on catastrophic events and returns the player to the last checkpoint. Regeneration stays expressive and ever-present; lives supply the stakes.

2. Two movement grammars, one axolotl. Water and land are mechanically distinct, joined by a water-powered dash as the signature transition skill. This is the answer to "why is this not a cute skin on generic platformer mechanics."

3. The world regenerates with you. Regions progress barren, resourced, restored — opening real traversal paths rather than swapping visuals — and Drift Fleet dredgers can undo that progress. This carries the open-source metaphor mechanically, without a child ever needing to notice it.

4. The repo is the game. Every world conforms to a versioned Level Contract published as a machine-readable schema. A contributor never needs to understand the whole game, only the contract. The project is effectively an open-source platformer SDK.

ANTAGONISTS
The Drift Fleet: faceless industrial extraction machinery, deliberately never human characters. Nets, hooks, dredges and pollution, with no gore and no humanized violence — the same machinery that broke the habitat is what the player disables to heal it.

MVP SCOPE
PC only. Two official worlds plus a minimal reference template. Three Gill Mods — Bubble, Jet, Glow — built to depth rather than breadth; Electric, Frost and Giant are post-MVP and double as the reference example for community-built mods. Contract compliance, asset conformance, and world static analysis are automated and merge-blocking, so an AI agent can verify its own work before submitting.

COMMUNITY (post-MVP)
Opens only once Level Contract v1 is frozen; opening earlier means every core update breaks early contributor worlds. Community worlds ship code like any other world — safety comes from static analysis against the sanctioned world API surface plus mandatory human review, never an automated-only merge path. This is a family game with an agent-authored contribution pipeline, so that gate is load-bearing.

NON-GOALS (firm, not deferrals)
No multiplayer, in any phase. No console certification. No level-editor GUI, ever — worlds are authored as code and Godot scenes only, so humans and AI agents build the same way and the contract surface stays narrow enough to check.

OPEN ITEMS
Licensing split between code and official art/audio, entangled with AI-generation provenance. Save-compatibility policy for forked and divergent worlds.

## Requirements — Your Scope

### REQ-028: Official World: Bubble Bay
Category: functional | Status: in-progress
The second official MVP world, and the second half of the Level Contract battle-test. Where Coral Cove hosts the Flagship encounter, Bubble Bay deliberately ships WITHOUT a boss — that is not a scope cut but a deliberate proof that the contract's optional elements really are optional and that a world declaring no boss remains valid and completable. It must emphasize a different Gill Mod from Coral Cove so the two official worlds together exercise all three MVP mods. Like every world it is built exclusively through the sanctioned world API surface, with no private back doors an outside contributor could not use, verified by the same static-analysis gate community submissions face.

## Technology Guidance

_Reference for executing the Implementation Tasks above — apply where relevant. The task list stands even where this guidance is thin._

**Purpose:** Open-source game engine for 2D and 3D games with its own GDScript language, C# support, and a scene-tree architecture

**SDK Initialization:**
```
# player.gd — client input, server authority via MultiplayerAPI
extends CharacterBody3D

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    if not is_multiplayer_authority():
        return
    var input := Input.get_vector("left", "right", "forward", "back")
    move_intent.rpc_id(1, input)  # send intent to server (peer 1), never position

@rpc("any_peer", "call_remote", "unreliable_ordered")
func move_intent(input: Vector2) -> void:
    if multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id() != get_multiplayer_authority():
        return  # reject spoofed intents
    velocity = _simulate(input)  # server simulates; clients receive replicated state
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use the scene tree and node composition for game architecture
- Leverage signals for decoupled communication between nodes
- Use resources (tres/res) for shared data and configuration
- Implement autoloads (singletons) sparingly for global state
- Use GDScript for gameplay logic and C# for complex systems
- Leverage AnimationPlayer and AnimationTree for state machines
- Use TileMaps and TileSets for 2D level design
- Export custom properties with @export for editor-configurable values

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Overusing get_node() with hardcoded paths instead of exported NodePaths
- Not using signals, creating tight coupling between nodes
- Putting all logic in _process without delta time consideration
- Creating deep node hierarchies instead of flat compositions
- Not using typed GDScript (static typing) for better performance and safety
- Ignoring the scene instancing system and duplicating node trees

**Security:** The shipped game is fully inspectable — GDScript decompiles trivially and PCK files unpack, so no API keys, no server credentials, and no authoritative logic in the client: purchases, scores, and inventory mutations happen on a backend the player cannot edit. In multiplayer, clients send INTENT (input) and the server simulates — validate every RPC server-side (sender identity, argument bounds, rate) because @rpc("any_peer") means exactly that. Savegames are user-editable files: sign or checksum what matters competitively, and never load untrusted .tscn/.gd content — instancing a scene executes its scripts.

**Suggested File Structure:**
- `scripts/main.gd` (source)
- `scenes/main.tscn` (source)
- `project.godot` (config)
- `export_presets.cfg` (config)

## Dependency Chain

Startup/initialization order based on edge directions and interaction patterns.

- Camera System (this node calls/depends on it via Camera Hint Interface (dependency))
- Save System (this node calls/depends on it via Save Integration Interface (dependency))
